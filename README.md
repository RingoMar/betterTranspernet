# BetterDiscord-Plugins-and-Themes
Unofficial Plugins and Themes for [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp)

This is a collection of plugins 'n themes. I'll try to keep them as up-to-date as possible.

Please note that not every single plugin/theme is by me. If i took your plugin/theme and you want to be credited somewhere here as author just tell me.

Everything goes to ``` %appdata%\BetterDiscord\ OR ~/Library/Preferences/BetterDiscord/themes in OSX ```

#__How to get a better Discord experience__:

`1.` If you don't have it, get **[Discord]**  (https://discordapp.com/apps)

`2.` Download **[BetterDiscord]** for your platform  (https://betterdiscord.net/home)

`3.` Then download the folder to your desktop

`4.` Find the folder where you would put the theme/Plugin, in (If folder can't be found go to your user setting and scroll down to `better dsicord` -> `themes` -> `open theme folder`) 

`5.` Refresh Discord with `[CTRL]` + `[R]` or just restart Discord completely.

`6.` Go to the **BetterDiscord** `settings` -> `plugins` tab and check all plugins you want.
